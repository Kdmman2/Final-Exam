    <h1>Reviews</h1>
    <p><span id="rightbox">The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
the streets of Charlotte.<br><br>

<span id="leftbox">Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.<br><br>
